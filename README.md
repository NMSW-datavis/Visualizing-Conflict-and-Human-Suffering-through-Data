# Visualizing Conflict and Human Suffering

### *Exploring the human stories behind data on global conflicts.*

This project aims to visualize data on **conflict and human suffering** through thoughtful, human-centered design. It is developed as part of the **Data Visualization Course** at the **Università di Genova**.

Our goal is to make complex datasets accessible and emotionally resonant; translating numbers into stories that reveal the human toll of global crises.

## Project Overview

### Objective
To build an **interactive website** that displays data visualizations related to global conflict, displacement, and humanitarian crises.

This website will evolve over time, with each update introducing a new visualization or data story. At present, it serves as a **foundation**: introducing the project's theme, purpose, and design direction.

## Design Philosophy

The visual identity is based on a poetic, organic approach to data storytelling.

**Key design choices:**
- **Minimal and soft color palette**: balancing seriousness and empathy
- **Circular, organic shapes**: representing people, connections, and ongoing movement
- **Generous whitespace and calm typography**: to evoke reflection and dignity
- **Smooth animations and gradients**: to create a modern and humane tone

### Typography
- **Headings:** Roboto Slab
- **Body Text:** Fira Sans

### Color Palette
| Purpose | Color | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Primary | `#003a70` | Deep blue (stability, seriousness) |
| Accent | `#f5b7a3` | Soft coral (empathy, warmth) |
| Background | `#fcfbf8` | Warm parchment white |
| Secondary | `#6b6b6b` | Muted grey for balance |
