        For decades, we have measured conflict by its location. We pin distinct red dots on static maps, marking a crisis in the Sahel, a war in Eastern Europe, or an insurgency in Southeast Asia. But a map is a snapshot of a single moment, and conflict is rarely static. It is a living, breathing entity that expands, contracts, and migrates over time.

      <p class="article">
        By analyzing reported civilian fatality data from the last 28 years, a different picture emerges—not one of isolated incidents, but of distinct rhythms. Some conflicts resemble a slow, rising tide, eroding stability over decades. Others appear as sudden, catastrophic waves that crash and recede.

      <h3>Tracing Conflict Through Time</h3>
      <p class="article">
        In the radial visualization below, time spirals outward. The center represents the late 1990s, while the outer edge brings us to the present day. Each country traces a path through this temporal tunnel, revealing its unique fingerprint of volatility. 
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        <strong>Solid dots</strong> represent years with reported fatalities. <strong>Hollow rings</strong> indicate years of relative peace. Notice the difference between the long, chronic arcs in Africa and the explosive, sudden spikes in the Middle East.
      </p>
      <p class="article"> 
        additionaly by selecting a single country we can see a line grph showing that country's fatalities over time. to visualize how time has affected that specific country. through it we can see the peaks and troughs of conflict within that nation. see if the conflict is esclating, perpetual , a one time event or deescalating. through this we can learn of a nations history of conflict and how it has changed over time.

      <h3>The Drifting Center of Gravity</h3>
      <p class="article">
        If the radial view shows us the <em>history</em> of specific nations, we must also look at the <em>geography</em> of global pain. Conflict is rarely contained within borders; it spills over, shifting its center of gravity from one region to another as geopolitical tides turn.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        The streamgraph below treats the data as a fluid. It aggregates fatalities by region, visualizing the displacement of violence over the last three decades. In the late 1990s, the chart is dominated by the aftermath of Cold War proxy battles in Sub-Saharan Africa. As we move into the 2010s, the focus shifts dramatically to the <strong>Middle East</strong> (Purple) during the Arab Spring, before shifting again with new escalations in Europe and Africa.

        The data serves as a stark reminder: peace in one region is often concurrent with escalation in another. The total volume of suffering does not always decrease; it merely moves.
