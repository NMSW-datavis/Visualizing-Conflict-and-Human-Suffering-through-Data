      <p>
        The world is not evenly at peace or at war. Conflict lives on a spectrum from quiet tension to devastating turmoil. Some nations face only sporadic unrest, while others endure relentless instability.
      </p>
      <p>
        But what does it mean when a country is labeled as “Extreme” risk? By combining recent conflict data with historical records, we can move beyond simple labels and uncover the lived realities they represent.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- HISTOGRAM -->
    <section class="chart-section" id="histogram-section">
      <h2>Part 1: The Global Landscape of Conflict</h2>
      <p>
        We begin with a global snapshot of conflict in 2024. The ACLED Conflict Index assigns each country a <strong>Total Score</strong> based on deadliness, danger, and fragmentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The histogram below shows how these scores are distributed worldwide. Notice its sharp skew: while most nations cluster toward stability, a small number the long tail to the right face intense, “Extreme” levels of violence. These are the true global hot spots.
      </p>

      <div class="chart-controls">
        <div class="control-group">
          <label for="histogram-range-min">Min Score:</label>
          <input type="range" id="histogram-range-min" name="histogram-range-min" step="0.1" />
          <span id="histogram-range-value-min">0.0</span>
        </div>
        <div class="control-group">
          <label for="histogram-range-max">Max Score:</label>
          <input type="range" id="histogram-range-max" name="histogram-range-max" step="0.1" />
          <span id="histogram-range-value-max"></span>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div id="histogram" class="chart-container"></div>
      <div id="histogram-info" class="chart-info-box"></div>

      <p class="transition-text">
        From a distance, the world seems calm but those few towering bars on the right remind us how concentrated global suffering truly is.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- BOXPLOT -->
    <section class="chart-section" id="boxplot-section">
      <h2>Part 2: The Human Cost of Volatility</h2>
      <p>
        To understand what “Extreme” looks like on the ground, we turn to the seven most-affected nations. The box plot below shows the distribution of <strong>reported civilian fatalities</strong> across years for each country.
      </p>
      <p>
        The median line inside each box marks the “typical” year. The box itself shows normal variation, while the whiskers stretch toward the worst. Some nations have a consistently high median steady tragedy. Others have low medians but long whiskers lives lived on a knife’s edge of volatility.
      </p>

      
      <div id="boxplot" class="chart-container"></div>

      <p class="transition-text">
        Every line, box, and dot here represents lives lost but more importantly, lives lived in uncertainty. Some endure steady loss; others brace for unpredictable catastrophe.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- VIOLIN PLOT -->
    <section class="chart-section" id="violin-section">
      <h2>Part 3: The Shape of Violence</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond averages, the violin plot below reveals the <strong>shape</strong> of violence showing how often different levels of fatalities occurred over time. The wider the section, the more common those outcomes; the thinner, the more exceptional.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some nations show a dense cluster at the lower end persistent but low-level violence. Others stretch into long, narrow tails: rare but catastrophic spikes. A few even display <strong>two bulges</strong>, reflecting a cycle that swings between calm and collapse where peace and crisis coexist in uneasy rhythm.
      </p>
<p> The color gradiant \ also tells a story: the story if the spike is recent or is this a long-standing issue? or is this a country plaged once up on a time with huge spikes that has now found a relative peace. </p>
      <div id="violin" class="chart-container"></div>

      <p class="transition-text">
        The data’s shape tells us what no average can: for many, survival depends not just on where they live, but on the year they’re born into.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- END -->
    <section id="story-end">
      <blockquote class="about-quote">
        “For civilians in these regions, danger isn’t constant it’s unpredictable. The threat isn’t only how high the numbers rise, but how suddenly they can.”
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        “Hot spot” countries aren’t defined solely by conflict intensity, but by instability itself. The data reminds us: volatility is its own form of violence and uncertainty, its cruelest weapon.
