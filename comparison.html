    <p>
      This story traces the anatomy of global conflict — from the countries most engulfed in violence, to the forms that violence takes,
      and finally to the collective toll on humanity. Through data, we can see not only where people are suffering,
      but also how the structure of conflict itself changes across time and place.

  <!-- 1. Bar Chart -->
  <section class="chart-section" id="bar-chart">
    <h2>Where the Fires Burn Brightest</h2>
    <p>
      The story begins with the places where violence burns brightest. These bars represent the world’s ten “Extreme” conflict zones in 2024 —
      nations like <strong>Sudan</strong>, <strong>Palestine</strong>, and <strong>Myanmar</strong>, where violence has become daily life.
      Each bar is a measure of intensity — the sum of fear, displacement, and loss condensed into a single score.
      Together, they mark the epicenters of today’s global suffering, where conflict is not a moment but a condition.

    <h2>The Anatomy Beneath “Extreme”</h2>
    <p>
      No two wars are alike. Some kill swiftly; others spread like slow poison.
      This visualization breaks conflict down into its core dimensions — <em>Deadliness</em>, <em>Diffusion</em>, <em>Danger</em>, and <em>Fragmentation</em> —
      across nations like <strong>Syria</strong>, <strong>Myanmar</strong>, and <strong>Palestine</strong>.
      In doing so, it reveals the anatomy of instability: which countries suffer from concentrated brutality, and which from chaos that multiplies without end.

  <!-- 3. Heatmap -->
  <section class="chart-section" id="heatmap">
    <h2>The Shifting Focus of Civilian Suffering</h2>
    <p>
      Behind every cell lies a story of violence and endurance. Some conflicts — like <strong>Ukraine’s</strong> — erupt suddenly,
      drawing sharp spikes of global attention. Others — like <strong>Nigeria</strong>, <strong>Sudan</strong>, or <strong>Republic of Congo</strong>
      have burned for years, steady and relentless, their toll woven into silence.
      The map below follows the geography of civilian death, showing how the focus of suffering has shifted over time.
      In its patterns, we can trace both the eruptions that shocked the world and the long wars the world forgot.

  <!-- 4. 100% Stacked Bar Chart -->
  <section class="chart-section" id="stacked-bar">
    <h2>When Regions Tell Different Stories</h2>
    <p>
      When viewed through regions rather than nations, the world’s pain divides differently.
      Africa bears the largest share of intrastate wars — conflicts that turn inward, consuming nations from within.
      In the Middle East, one-sided violence and cross-border hostilities shape the pattern.
      Asia’s wars, meanwhile, are as varied as its terrain.
      Each bar represents not only lives lost, but the character of conflict — showing how culture, geography, and power define the ways people suffer.
    </p>
    <div id="stacked-bar-chart-container" class="chart-container"></div>
  </section>

 <section class="chart-section" id="waffle-chart">
  <h2>The World as a Mosaic of Loss</h2>
  <p>
    When we look closely, the data turns back into people. Each square below represents
    <strong>one percent</strong> of all lives lost to conflict — small, silent pieces of a much larger grief.
  </p>

  <p>
    The colors tell different kinds of stories: <em>intrastate wars</em>, where nations fracture from within;
    <em>one-sided violence</em>, where civilians themselves become the targets; <em>non-state conflicts</em>, where
    armed groups fight outside government control; and <em>interstate wars</em>, when countries face each other across borders.
  </p>

  <p>
    In <strong>The Middle East</strong>, much of the loss comes from wars fought across borders. While in <strong>Africa</strong>,
    the toll often falls on civilians trapped in one-sided attacks. Elsewhere the colors shift, but the meaning doesn’t change:
    each shade, each square, carries the weight of lives interrupted.

  <!-- 6. Circle Packing -->
  <section class="chart-section" id="circle-packing">
    <h2>The Weight of History</h2>
    <p>
      Some nations carry scars so deep they shape the world’s collective memory.
      In this visualization, each circle is a country, its size representing the total number of deaths recorded across decades of armed conflict.
      The largest circles — <strong>Ethiopia</strong>, <strong>Syria</strong>, <strong>Rwanda</strong>, <strong>Ukraine</strong> —
      mark histories that have already defined generations.
      Clustered together, they form constellations of suffering — a quiet geography of human loss that stretches beyond borders.

  <!-- 7. Dumbbell Plot -->
  <section class="chart-section" id="dumbbell-plot">
    <h2>Between Fear and Fatality</h2>
    <p>
      In the most violent corners of the world, danger and deadliness do not always move together.
      This plot compares them directly: one dot for <em>how fatal</em> a conflict is, the other for <em>how unstable</em>.
      In some nations, like <strong>Sudan</strong>, death itself defines the danger; in others, like <strong>Myanmar</strong>,
      chaos, not lethality, makes survival uncertain.
      Between the two dots, the line — the “dumbbell” — captures that fragile space where people live between fear and fatality.

  <!-- 8. Stacked Bar (Small Multiples) -->
  <section class="chart-section" id="small-multiples">
    <h2>The Structure Within Regions</h2>
    <p>
      The story ends where it began — in regions, not numbers.
      Each small multiple below zooms into a region’s internal structure:
      Africa, Asia, the Middle East.
      Inside each, countries stack their bars by <em>types of violence</em>, revealing the internal architecture of suffering.
      It’s the same global story, seen through local eyes — the same wounds, reshaped by geography and history.
