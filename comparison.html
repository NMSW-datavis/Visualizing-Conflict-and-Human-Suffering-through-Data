    <p>
      This story traces the anatomy of global conflict — from the countries most engulfed in violence, to the forms that violence takes,
      and finally to the collective toll on humanity. Through data, we can see not only where people are suffering,
      but also how the structure of conflict itself changes across time and place.

  <section class="chart-section" id="bar-chart">
    <h2>Where the Fires Burn Brightest</h2>
    <p>
      The story begins with the places where violence burns brightest. These bars represent the world’s ten “Extreme” conflict zones in 2024 —
      nations like <strong>Sudan</strong>, <strong>Palestine</strong>, and <strong>Myanmar</strong>, where violence has become daily life.
      Each bar is a measure of intensity — the sum of fear, displacement, and loss condensed into a single score.
      Together, they mark the epicenters of today’s global suffering, where conflict is not a moment but a condition.

                    No two conflicts are alike. This visualization breaks the world’s five most intense 'Extreme'
            conflicts in **2024** into four core dimensions—
            <em>Deadliness</em>, <em>Diffusion</em>, <em>Danger</em>, and <em>Fragmentation</em>.
            Comparing nations like <strong>Palestine</strong>, <strong>Myanmar</strong>, and
            <strong>Mexico</strong> reveals the varying structures of conflict, showing which nations face high
            lethality and which struggle with widespread internal chaos.

  <h2>The Shifting Focus of Civilian Suffering</h2>
<p>
  Behind every cell lies a story of violence and endurance. Some conflicts  like <strong>Ukraine</strong>  erupted suddenly in 2022,
  drawing sharp spikes of global attention. Others: like <strong>Nigeria</strong>, <strong>Sudan</strong>, or the <strong>Democratic Republic of Congo</strong> — have persisted for years,
  their toll steady and relentless, often unnoticed by the wider world. 
  The map below follows the geography of civilian death, showing how the focus of suffering has shifted over time.
  Through its patterns, we can trace both the sudden crises that shocked the world and the long-running wars that endured in silence.

  <!-- 4. 100% Stacked Bar Chart -->
  <section class="chart-section" id="stacked-bar">
    <h2>When Regions Tell Different Stories</h2>
    <p>
      When viewed through regions rather than nations, the world’s pain divides differently.
      Africa bears the largest share of intrastate wars — conflicts that turn inward, consuming nations from within.
      In the Middle East, one-sided violence and cross-border hostilities shape the pattern.
      Asia’s wars, meanwhile, are as varied as its terrain.
      Each bar represents not only lives lost, but the character of conflict — showing how culture, geography, and power define the ways people suffer.

  <h2>The World as a Mosaic of Loss</h2>
 <p>
  When we look closely, the data turns back into people. Each square below represents 
  <strong>one percent</strong> of all lives lost to conflict small, silent pieces of a much larger grief.
</p>

<p>
  The colors tell different kinds of stories: <em>intrastate wars</em>, where nations fracture from within; 
  <em>one-sided violence</em>, where civilians become the targets; <em>non-state conflicts</em>, where 
  armed groups fight outside government control; and <em>interstate wars</em>, when countries face each other across borders.
</p>

<p>
  In <strong>The Middle East</strong>, most fatalities come from intrastate wars — conflicts between governments and armed groups within the same country. 
  In <strong>Africa</strong>, a large portion of deaths are due to one-sided violence, where civilians are targeted by state or non-state actors. 
  Elsewhere, the colors shift, but the meaning doesn’t change: each shade, each square, carries the weight of lives interrupted.

  <section class="chart-section" id="dumbbell-plot">
    <h2>Between Fear and Fatality</h2>
    <p>
      In the most violent corners of the world, danger and deadliness do not always move together.
      This plot compares them directly: one dot for <em>how fatal</em> a conflict is, the other for <em>how unstable</em>.
      In some nations, like <strong>Sudan</strong>, death itself defines the danger; in others, like <strong>Myanmar</strong>,
      chaos, not lethality, makes survival uncertain.
      Between the two dots, the line — the “dumbbell” — captures that fragile space where people live between fear and fatality.

      The story ends where it began — in regions, not numbers.
      Each small multiple below zooms into a region’s internal structure:
      Africa, Asia, the Middle East.
      Inside each, countries stack their bars by <em>types of violence</em>, revealing the internal architecture of suffering.
      It’s the same global story, seen through local eyes — the same wounds, reshaped by geography and history.
